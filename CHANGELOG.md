# Changelog

## 0.9.1

* Bug fixes
  * Enable HTTPS semantics for X.509 certificate validation. This fixes an issue
    where wildcard certificates were being incorrectly reported as invalid.
    Thanks to @doawoo for this fix.

## 0.9.0

This releases shifts preferance to token authentication rather than the user
client certificate that was being used. This changes is backwards compatible
and you can continue to use certificates, but a warning will be emmitted.
See [nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web#818](https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web/pull/818)
for more details.

* New features
  * Added `:token` to `%NervesHubUserAPI.Auth{}` struct for token based authentication
  * `NervesHubUserAPI.User.login/3` to authenticate and create a token for later use

## 0.8.0

* Breaking Changes
  * This release includes a change to how CA certificates are used in the connection
    to NervesHub. If you are connecting to the publicly hosted https://nerves-hub.org,
    then no changes are required.
    If you are manually supplying `:ca_certs` config value to connect to another instance
    of NervesHub, then you will need to update you config following the new instructions
    for [Configuration](README.md#configuration) in the README
